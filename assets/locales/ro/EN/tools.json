Although this may seem counterintuitive for people struggling with anxiety, it can actually help gain control over obsessive thoughts. If you find yourself worrying at night, schedule a time below when you can think about the issues on your mind.",

Scheduling a time for worries can help people gain control over anxious thoughts that may keep them awake.\n\nChoose a time during the day to think, worry, solve problems and plan what you need to do. Then, if intrusive thoughts appear during your sleep period, postpone them for the \"thinking and worrying time\" the next day. Make sure you don't choose a time too close to bedtime, so you have a chance to relax afterwards.\n\nBy scheduling a daily period to focus on your concerns, you'll notice that you have fewer worrying thoughts while in bed.\n\nMany people catch themselves worrying that they can't fall asleep, which unfortunately can keep them even more awake. Remember that while lack of sleep can be uncomfortable, your body is designed to tolerate less good nights. In fact, sleep loss can increase sleep desire, which can lead to improved sleep quality in subsequent nights. It's important to reduce nighttime anxiety to improve your chances of getting quality sleep.",
